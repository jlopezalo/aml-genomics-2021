## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
-   This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
-   Please ensure that your contribution complies with this document. If it does not, you will need to address and fix all issues before we can merge your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable.

## Overview

Being an Open Source project, everyone can contribute, provided that you respect the following points:

-   Before contributing any code, the author must make sure all the tests work (see below how to launch the tests).
-   Developed code must adhere to the syntax guidelines enforced by the linters.
-   Code must be developed following the [SemVer (Semantic Versioning 2.0.0)](https://semver.org/) branching model.
-   For any new feature added, unit tests must be provided, following the example of the ones already created.

## How to contribute

If you would like to suggest a new feature/new features for this project, please raise a **Feature request** issue in the [issues section](issues/new/choose) section. A template is provided that will allow you to provide your suggestions for your feature request.

### Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's
[Issues](issues) and [Pull Requests](pulls) sections, or the [discussions](discussions). Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.

### Getting Started

In order to start contributing:

![Fork](assets/images/fork.jpg)

1. Fork this repository clicking on the "Fork" button on the upper-right area of the page.

2. Clone your just forked repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourAccount/AML-Genomics-2021.git
```

3. Add the main AML-Genomics-2021 repository as a remote to your forked repository:

```bash
git remote add AML-Genomics-2021 https://github.com/AmlResearchProject/AML-Genomics-2021.git
```

Before starting your contribution, remember to synchronize the latest `dev` branch in your forked repository with the `dev` branch in the main AML-Genomics-2021 repository as specified by the **CURRENT DEV BRANCH** badge in the repository [README](README.md). To do this, use following these steps

1. Change to your local `dev` branch (in case you are not in it already):

```bash
git checkout 1.0.0
```

2. Fetch the remote changes:

```bash
git fetch AML-Genomics-2021
```

3. Merge them:

```bash
git rebase AML-Genomics-2021/1.0.0
```

Contributions following these guidelines will be added to the `dev` branch, and released in the next version. The release process is explained in the _Releasing_ section below.

### Documentation

Changes you make to the code in the repository or new projects that you make should be supported with documentation added to the **docs** directory.

It is the contributor's responsibility to ensure that the documentation is up to date. If you are contributing to an existing repository you will ensure that these documents are updated and/or added to to reflect your changes.

We use [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) along with [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). Use the [Getting Started with MkDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html) guide to find out how to update/create documentation for the project.

### Repository structure

**Directories and files may be added to the above structure as required, but none must be removed.**

### Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are part of our "framework". Contributors may modify abstract classes by adding new methods or removing redundant methods. If you modify an abstract class make sure to add your attribution in the contributors area in the header.

### Installation Scripts

The default installation script is [install.sh](scripts/install.sh) found in the [scripts](scripts) directory.

You must include the installation commands for all libraries for the project using apt/pip/make etc. Replace **# DEVELOPER TO ADD INSTALLATION COMMANDS FOR ALL REQUIRED LIBRARIES (apt/pip etc)** with the relevant installation commands. If you are contributing an existing repository you will ensure that these scripts are updated to reflect your changes.

### Logging

The [helpers file](modules/helpers.py) handles all logging for the project. Loggig should be used in all cases rather than `print()`. The following logs are supported:

- all
- error
- warning

### Configuration

The project configuration file [config.json](configuration/config.json) can be found in the [configuration](configuration) directory.

All configurable variables should be held within this file and used wherever relevant throughout the project.

### Branching model

There are one special branch in the repository:

-   `main`: contains the tagged and released version
-   `1.0.0`: is the current `dev` branch and contains the latest development code. New features and bugfixes are always merged to current `dev` branch.

In order to start developing a new feature or refactoring, a new branch will be created following the SemVer scheme:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible code changes,
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

- If `MAJOR` is 0, then Minor could mean the version is not backwards compatible
- If `MINOR` is 1, this means the release is stable.

The branch will be created by our team depending on the nature of your issue. Once the new functionality has been completed, a Pull Request will be created from the feature branch to the relevant branch. Remember to check both the linters, and
the tests before creating the Pull Request.

In order to contribute to the repository, the same scheme should be replicated in the forked repositories, so the new features or fixes should all come from the current version of `dev` branch and end up in the current `dev` branch again.

### PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code

All Python projects must align with the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### CII Best Practices

All projects must align with the [CII Best Practice](https://www.construction-institute.org/resources/knowledgebase/best-practices).

### Changelog

The project contains a changelog that is automatically created from the description of the Pull Requests that have been merged into develop, thanks to the [Release Drafter GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).

### Releasing

The process of making a release simply consists of creating the release in Github and providing the new tag name, this task is carried out by our team.

### Version numbers

The version number will change for each release, following the SemVer scheme described previously.

### Bugfix in releases

When a bug is found affecting a release, a branch will be created from the `main` branch. As a part of the patch, the release version will be increased in it's last number (Z). The patch then will be merged (via pull request (PR)) to the `main` branch, and a new version will be released.

### Commits

Commits should be [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit), make commits to your fork until you have resolved/completed the work specified in your issue before submitting your PR, this keeps an easy to follow history of what work has been carried out and makes the review process easier and quicker

When making a commit, the subjects of each commit should be as follows, where XXX represents the issue number, # must :

#### Commit Title

##### Bug Fixes

- fix #xxx
- fixes #xxx
- fixed #xxx

##### Partial Resolutions

- partially resolves #xxx
- partially resolved #xxx

##### Resolution

- resolves #xxx
- resolved #xxx

##### Alignment

- aligns with #xxx

##### Closure

- close #xxx
- closes #xxx
- closed #xxx

#### Commit Description

Your commit description should include a detailed description of the changes that have been made.

#### Committing

When you are ready to commit, you should do the following:

##### Show The Status Of All Changed/Added/Deleted files

```
git status
```

##### Diff

You may want to check the differences between changed files, you can do this using the following command.

```
git diff
```

##### Add All Changes

The following will add all changes shown by git status to your commit.

```
git add .
```

##### Add One Or More Changes

```
git add file1 file2 file5
```

##### Commit Added Changes

Commit your added changes to your local repository, remember to follow the [Commit Title](#commit-title) & [Commit Description](#commit-description) guides above.

To create your commit with both a title and description, use the following command which states the commit fixes issue ID 1 and provides a detailed description:

```
git commit -m "fixes #1" -m "Fixes the documentation typos described in issue #1"
```

### Push Your Changes

When you have made your changes, ensured you have aligned with the procedures in this document, and made your commits to your local repository aligning with the guide above, you need to push your changes to your forked repository.

Push changes to your fork by using the following command:

```
git push
```

### Pull Request protocol

Contributions to the AML-Genomics-2021 repository are done using a PR. The detailed "protocol" used in such PR is described below:

* Direct commits to main or develop branches (even single-line modifications) are not allowed. Every modification has to come as a PR to the latest `dev branch`
* PRs implement/fix submitted issues, the issue number has to be referenced in the subject of the relevant commit and PR
* Anybody is welcome to provide comments to the PR (either direct comments or using the review feature offered by Github)
* Use *code line comments* instead of *general comments*, for traceability reasons (see comments lifecycle below)
* Comments lifecycle
    * Comment is created, initiating a *comment thread*
    * New comments can be added as responses to the original one, starting a discussion
    * After discussion, the comment thread ends in one of the following ways:
        * `Fixed in <commit hash>` in case the discussion involves a fix in the PR branch (which commit hash is included as reference)
        * `NTC`, if finally nothing needs to be done (NTC = Nothing To Change)
* PR can be merged when the following conditions are met:
    * All comment threads are closed
    * All the participants in the discussion have provided a `LGTM` general comment (LGTM = Looks good to me)
    * All documentation has been updated to reflect your changes.
    * No proprietory software or images have been added.

* Self-merging is not allowed (except in rare and justified circumstances)

Some additional remarks to take into account when contributing with new PRs:

* PR must include not only code contributions, but their corresponding pieces of documentation (new or modifications to existing one) and tests
* Documentation must be added to the **docs** folder
* In the case empty directories need to be uploaded, add a `.gitkeep` file inside.
* The project banner is included in all documentation
* Contributing, Versioning, Licensing, Bugs/Issues footer is included in all information
* Contributors have been added to all Contributors footers
* PR modifications must pass full regression based on existing tests in addition to whichever new test added due to the new functionality
* PR should be of an appropriated size that makes review achievable. Too large PRs could be closed with a "please, redo the work in smaller pieces" without any further discussion
