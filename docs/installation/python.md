## Clone the repository

Clone the [Acute Myeloid Leukemia Genomics 2021](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Genomics-2021 " Acute Myeloid Leukemia Genomics 2021") repository from the [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid & Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid & Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project") Github Organization.

To clone the repository and install the project, make sure you have Git installed. Now navigate to the directory you would like to clone the project to and then use the following command.

``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Genomics-2021.git
```

This will clone the Acute Myeloid Leukemia Genomics 2021 repository and move the cloned repository to the agents directory in the HIAS project (components/agents/mqtt/).

``` bash
 ls
```

Using the ls command in your home directory should show you the following.

``` bash
 AML-Genomics-2021
```

Navigate to the **AML-Genomics-2021** directory, this is your project root directory for this tutorial.
