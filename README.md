# Introduction
An Acute Myeloid Leukemia diagnostics project based on the research outlined in [Scalable Prediction of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using High-Dimensional Machine Learning and Blood Transcriptomics](https://www.cell.com/iscience/pdf/S2589-0042(19)30525-5.pdf) by Stefanie WarnatHerresthal, Konstantinos Perrakis, Bernd Taschler, Torsten Haferlach, Sach Mukherjee & Joachim L. Schultze.

# DISCLAIMER

Theis project should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the project is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnostics systems.

Although the classifier is accurate and shows good results both on paper and in real world testing, it is not meant to be an alternative to professional medical diagnosis.

Salvatore Raieli is a bioinformatician researcher and PhD in Immunology, but does not work in medical diagnosis.

Please use this system responsibly.
